#########################
This repository provides a setup to deploy a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and Docker-compose. With this setup, you can automate the build, test, and deployment processes of your software projects.
#############

# Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure that you have the following software installed on your machine:

Docker: Install Docker
Docker-compose: Install Docker-compose
Getting Started

# Step 1

To deploy the CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins, follow these steps:

Clone this repository: https://github.com/your-username/your-repo
Navigate to the project folder.

# Step 2

Starting the Jenkins Server
Run the following command to start the Jenkins server using Docker-compose:

Copy code
docker-compose up -d
Access Jenkins in your browser at http://localhost:8080.

# Step 3

Configuring Jenkins
On the Jenkins web interface, follow the setup wizard to unlock Jenkins and install the suggested plugins.

Create a new Jenkins pipeline job to define your CI/CD pipeline. You can use a Jenkinsfile to define your pipeline stages and steps.

Customize the Jenkinsfile to include your build, test, and deployment processes according to your project requirements.

Triggering the CI/CD Pipeline
Once the Jenkins pipeline is defined and configured, you can trigger the pipeline manually or set up webhooks or scheduled jobs to trigger it automatically on code changes.
Monitoring and Managing the CI/CD Pipeline
Monitor the status and progress of your CI/CD pipeline by accessing the Jenkins dashboard. You can view build logs, test results, and deployment status.

Customize and extend your CI/CD pipeline as per your project needs. Explore Jenkins plugins and integrations to enhance the automation and efficiency of your pipeline.

That's it! You have now successfully deployed a CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins using Docker-compose. You can now automate your software development processes and streamline your workflows.
